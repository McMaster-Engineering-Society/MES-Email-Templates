# Hatch Booking System - React Email Templates

This repository provides a suite of email templates for the Hatch Booking System, including example and production-ready emails. It enables a live preview in your browser, so you donâ€™t need to send real emails during development.

This repository was created with the [React Email Template starter](https://react.email/docs/getting-started/automatic-setup).

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Start by installing the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**

   Launch the development server to preview email templates live:

   ```sh
   npm run dev

   ```

Open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser to see the emails in action.

To use the email templates, copy the HTML from each desired email template in the localhost GUI into the MES-Website-App-Router repository.
